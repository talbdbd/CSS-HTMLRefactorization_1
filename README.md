# CSS-HTMLRefactorization_1

## Description

The goal of this project was to complete a refactoring challenge by condensing and making the provided code more efficient.
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- The motivation was to refactor the code efficiently while maintaining the same HTML structure and CSS styling.
- I built this project to test my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and how well I can improve existing code given a real world professional collaborative scenario.
- The main solution I provided was reworking the existing code to be more succinct while maintaining the same output and allowing future add ons to be applied as easily as before.
- My main learning experience from this project was how to how collaborate on code without taking away the work that was already put in and only focus on improving/fixing what should be improved/fixed.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
