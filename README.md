# Tal's Risky Refactorization Roundout

## Description

The goal of this project was to complete a refactoring challenge by condensing and making the provided code more efficient.

- The motivation was to refactor the code efficiently while maintaining the same HTML structure and CSS styling.
- I built this project to test my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and how well I can improve existing code given a real world professional collaborative scenario.
- The main solution I provided was reworking the existing code to be more succinct while maintaining the same output and allowing future add ons to be applied as easily as before.
- My main learning experience from this project was how to how collaborate on code without taking away the work that was already put in and only focus on improving/fixing what should be improved/fixed.
